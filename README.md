# Finite-Abelian-Groups
This writing assignment is written in fulfillment for the Abstract Algebra course in the Spring 2022 semester.

In this paper, our goal is to apply the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups on a defined abelian group. The group we are using in this paper is: U(432). U(432) is the group of all classes, each of which is a positive number smaller than 432 and relatively prime to 432,i.e.U(432) is the group of all positive i’s smaller than 432 where gcdi432 = 1 (gcd is the abbreviation of Greastest Common Divisor). Furthermore, U(432)is a group under the operation multiplication modulo 432. Having our group defined, in sections 2 & 3, we will first introduce the underlying theories of the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups. We will then use our pre-defined group to put the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups to practice. The process is done by first finding the order of the group and sub- sequently finding the elements of U(432)(section 4). Accordingly, in section 5, we indicate how many isomorphisms are there possible for U(432). In section 6 we find the order of all elements in U(432)and write them in table 1. By looking at table 1 and the orders of the el- ements, we can cancel out the unaccepted isomorphisms. Moreover, in section 7 we find the distinctive cyclic subgroups generated by the elements of U(432). Finally in section 8, we will show examples of how to write U(432)as the direct product of it’s cyclic sbgroups.

For the coding sections, "python" has been used.
